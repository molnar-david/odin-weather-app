Weather app, made using the Visual Crossing Weather API (https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api) and async functions.\
Just enter a location (city or country) in the top left corner, and it will display the latest weather data, a 24-hour forecast, and a 14-day forecast.
Focus was on functionality, not design, so it has minimal styling as of now.
